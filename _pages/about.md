I am currently a final-year PhD student at the College of Electrical and Information Engineering and the National Engineering Laboratory for Robot Visual Perception and Control Technology, Hunan University, Changsha, China, under the supervision of Prof. [Min Liu](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1291/5218.htm) and in collaboration with Prof. [Erik Meijering](https://imagescience.org/meijering/).   

My research interest mainly focuses on pattern recognition, deep-learning based bioimage analysis, neuron microscopy image segmentation and neuron reconstruction.
